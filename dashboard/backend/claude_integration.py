## Overview
Based on the provided overview and prompt, here's a comprehensive development plan.

## Project Context
{overview}

## Requirements Analysis
{prompt}

## Architecture Decisions
- Frontend: React with TypeScript for type safety
- Backend: FastAPI for high-performance API
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data
- Authentication: JWT-based auth system
- Deployment: Docker containers with CI/CD

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish project structure and development environment

Tasks:
1. Initialize project repository and structure
2. Set up development environment and tooling
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline
4. Create basic documentation

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Build the foundational components

Tasks:
1. Implement authentication system
2. Set up database models and migrations
3. Create API structure and routing
4. Build basic UI components library

### Phase 3: Feature Development (Week 4-6)
**Goal**: Implement main features

Tasks:
1. Build user management features
2. Implement core business logic
3. Create main UI views and flows
4. Add data validation and error handling

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 7)
**Goal**: Ensure quality and reliability

Tasks:
1. Write comprehensive test suite
2. Perform integration testing
3. Add monitoring and logging
4. Optimize performance

### Phase 5: Deployment & Launch (Week 8)
**Goal**: Deploy to production

Tasks:
1. Configure production environment
2. Set up monitoring and alerts
3. Perform security audit
4. Create user documentation

## Technical Specifications

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- Versioned API (v1, v2, etc.)
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Comprehensive error handling

### Database Schema
- User management tables
- Core business entities
- Audit and logging tables
- Performance indexes

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Environment variable management

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular code reviews
- Automated testing pipeline
- Staging environment testing
- Incremental deployment strategy

## Success Metrics
- 95% test coverage
- <200ms API response time
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive documentation
