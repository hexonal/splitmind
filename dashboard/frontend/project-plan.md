# Project Plan: Example E-commerce Platform

## Overview
A modern, mobile-first e-commerce platform designed specifically for handmade crafts, connecting craft sellers with buyers. The platform will feature user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, Stripe payment integration, and dedicated seller dashboards. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, emphasizing responsive design and seamless user experience.

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for global state, React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with mobile-first approach
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for consistency with frontend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching/sessions
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database queries
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for product images
- **API Design**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 for backend, CloudFront CDN for frontend
- **Container**: Docker for consistent deployment environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, CloudWatch for metrics
- **Payment**: Stripe Connect for marketplace payments

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS everywhere with SSL certificates
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
